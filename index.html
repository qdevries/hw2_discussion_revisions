<h1>About Me</h1>


<p id="main" tabindex="-1"></p> 

<p>
    I'm Quin, as a first year masters at University of Michigan- Ann Arbor studying Information Science, 
    I am an aspiring UX Researcher who loves to solve human centered problems in creative, yet logical ways.
    Asking questions and piecing together solutions is what I love to do, especially within interdisciplinary 
    research. 
    <br><br>
    During my undergraduate at Iowa State University, it was a Design Heuristics workshop that inspired
    me to intertwine my research experiences, passion for design, psychology background, and multi-faceted
    problem-solving skills into a career; however, at the time, I was not sure how.
    Post graduation, as a Marketing and Sales Associate, I accidently stumbled upon UX and from that moment 
    I knew this is the career I was searching for. 
    <br><br>
    Thank you for your patience, I am releasing pages and content frequently. 
    <br><br> 
     
    In the meantime, my resume, email, and LinkedIn can be found below.
